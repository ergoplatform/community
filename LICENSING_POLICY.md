# Ergo Licensing Policy

In order to ensure an open source project is actually open and re-usable in a legal sense, 
it’s critical that licensing information is clear. 
Repositories in the `ergoplatform` and `ScorexFoundation` organizations should all follow this policy 
for licensing their contents.

Unless there is a particular reason to use a different licensing structure, please use 
the following for new projects:

1. Copyright should always be assigned to **Ergoplatform, Inc.,** regardless of the type of license. 
(In an ideal future, we can assign copyright to a foundation.)

2. All software code should be licensed under the MIT license. Canonical license text for 
the MIT license can be found in this repository’s [`LICENSE` file](../LICENSE) or at the 
[Open Source Initiative website](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

3. All documentation and non-code resources (e.g. logos and imagery) should be licensed under 
the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. 
An [easy-to-read, linkable description](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) 
and canonical license text in [HTML](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) 
and [plain text](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt) can be found at 
the Creative Commons website.

    If a repository is a software project with some built-in docs or resources (e.g. `ergo`), 
    it can all be licensed under the MIT license. The CC BY license is meant for projects that 
    are not overwhelmingly code, such as websites, guidance, discussion repos, and so on.


## Attaching a License

When licensing a project, be sure to:

1. Name the license and provide a link to it from the project README under the heading “license.” Example:

    ```md
    ## License
    
    Copyright (c) Ergoplatform, Inc. under the **<LICENSE NAME>**. See [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for details.
    ```
    
    Or for multiple licenses:
    
    ```md
    ## License
    
    All software code is copyright (c) Ergoplatform, Inc. under the **MIT license**.
    
    Other written documentation and content is copyright (c) Ergoplatform, Inc. under the **Creative Commons Attribution License**.
    
    See [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for details.
    ```

2. For software that will be redistributed, the full text of the license(s) **must** be in a file named 
`LICENSE` in the repository root. Other projects **should** do this, too, but their readmes can alternatively 
link to a separate license document, like this: [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).


## Contributor Licensing (DCO)

We manage contributor licensing via a *Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).* 
All commits with new code from any contributor **must** include a DCO signoff trailer. 
See the [contributing guide part 2](../CONTRIBUTING-2.md#a-license-and-a-signed-off-by-trailers-are-required) 
for more details. Commits with extremely trivial or changes or that do not change content (e.g. merge commits) are excepted.

If you’re setting up a new repository, make sure the README includes a link to our contribution guidelines 
so people can find information about the DCO signoff.
